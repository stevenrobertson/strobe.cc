Here's a quote from a recent article_ about Android:

    I think Google Android chief Andy Rubin best addressed [Steve Jobs']
    argument with his recent tweet_.

.. _article: http://blogs.computerworld.com/17196/dear_steve_jobs_youre_wrong_again
.. _tweet: http://twitter.com/Arubin/status/27808662429

Another one, from an analysis_\ [#]_ on the same subject:

    In theory, Android is more open than Apple on the software side;
    `Andy Rubin's point`_ is irrefutable.

.. _Andy Rubin's point: http://twitter.com/Arubin/status/27808662429

.. [#]  Full disclosure: I helped write it.

One of these leaves me thinking about what Mr. Rubin said; the other,
about *where he said it*.

Such neologisms are occasionally appropriate, and can convey helpful
information and context to the reader. However, the popularity of Twitter,
Facebook, and other "new media" ensures that your audience will have a
broad set of stories and experiences keyed to these terms. Invoking the
proper names for these tools can burn through much of your reader's
acutely finite attention span.
