- title: Quodlibot, a Google Code IRC bot

*Update*: Man, has it really been less than three years before I discovered
that GitHub was a way better means to share stuff like this? Well, in any
case, this (s)crappy little bot is decidedly unmaintained now.

I was looking for a simple IRC bot which would announce changes to the `Quod
Libet`_ project, like what CIA_ does for version control. Finding none, I
hacked one together in about an hour, using Twisted_ and `Feed Parser`_. It's
trivial, but code that isn't shared is lost, and it may save a few others some
time in the future. If you maintain a GC project and want me to host an
instance of the bot, send me an email.
