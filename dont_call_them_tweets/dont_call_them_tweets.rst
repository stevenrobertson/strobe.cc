Don't call them tweets.

Or blog entries, or Facebook posts.

Here's a quote from a recent article_ about Android:

    I think Google Android chief Andy Rubin best addressed [Steve Jobs']
    argument with his recent tweet_.

.. _article: http://blogs.computerworld.com/17196/dear_steve_jobs_youre_wrong_again
.. _tweet: http://twitter.com/Arubin/status/27808662429

Another one, from an analysis_\ [#]_ on the same subject:

    In theory, Android is more open than Apple on the software side; `Andy
    Rubin's point` is irrefutable.

.. _Andy Rubin's point: http://twitter.com/Arubin/status/27808662429

.. [#]  Full disclosure: I helped write it.

One of these leaves me thinking about what Mr. Rubin said; the other,
about *where he said it*.

Such neologisms are occasionally appropriate, and convey helpful
information and context to the reader. However, the popularity of Twitter,
Facebook, and other "new media" ensures that your audience will have a
broad set of stories and experiences keyed to these terms. Invoking the
proper names for these tools can burn a surprising amount of your reader's
acutely finite attention span.
