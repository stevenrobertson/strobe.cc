Well, actually, no. Don't do that yet.

Not that I wouldn't love to work for you. Really. I'm sure we'd do great things
together. But I currently plan to focus on my thesis, and I wouldn't be
surprised if there's some work left to do even after graduation in order to
ensure that it has the maximum effectiveness. I want to give you my full
attention, so I need to take care of that and a few other things first.

If for some reason you're undeterred by the lack of a résumé, feel free to send
me an email (steven@strobe.cc), give me a call (1 813 728 7254), or contact me
via LinkedIn_. I may not have time to work for you right now, but knowing that
you're interested will help me make better decisions.
