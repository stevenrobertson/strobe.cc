I'm an electrical and computer engineering student — more or less — at
UCF_. Although I have completed all course requirements, I cannot graduate
until the end of Fall 2011. Long story.

.. _UCF: http://ucf.edu/

While I wait, I'm working on some open-source projects, as well as taking a
few freelance gigs to get by. At the time of writing, I have a number of
aaaaaaalmost-finished projects that keep getting superseded before being
released. This should change soon. When it does, I'll write about them
here.

Careerwise, I was an Apple intern in 2009 (iPod media playback).

I am remarkably fond of footnotes\ [#]_.

.. [#]  If you're viewing them on the site, they should really be margin
        notes.

The site itself is static HTML. You can check out the entire site,
including the rendering scripts, from the root URL using Mercurial::

    hg clone http://strobe.cc/ strobe

There's a good story behind why the site has both code and data in the same
repository. Who knows, I might write it down some day.
