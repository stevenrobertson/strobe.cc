Voting in the face of uncertainty

The US Senate, in particular, has a deadlock problem; filibustering
effectively requires a supermajority in order for action to be taken, and the
tactic is being used with unprecedented frequency.

Party-line voting is rampant. 78 members of the 112th congress `voted with
their party affiliation`_ more than 90% of the time, with a median across
congress of 93%.

Yea or nay voting offers no direct means of expressing partial support for a
bill.  Every vote is therefore a matter of "if you're not with us, you're
against us," which reinforces the behaviors of party-line voting.

The result, I posit, is a culture of certainty. While rhetoric is important in
influencing others, the political identity of a senator is ultimately defined
by his or her voting record. Without a means to express partial support in the
voting record, these individuals cannot encode uncertainty in their identity.
Every vote becomes an all-or-nothing bet, and any deviation is seen a betrayal
of one's principles â€” or an indication that one had no principles to begin
with.

This hostile environment severely constrains the set of choices realistically
afforded to individual senators. Since individuals cannot express partial
support for a bill, it becomes necessary to resort to back-room deals and
political games in order to accomplish goals. If a senator already knows that
he or she must vote for a bill for political reasons, that senator is morally
obligated to modify the bill *iteslf* in order to make it favorable enough to
vote for in good faith.

A solution presents itself: allot each senator one hundred votes instead of
one.

This affords several previously unavailable nuances to senators. Objections to
provisions in a bill can be recorded in a meaningful way without needing to
reject the bill entirely or attach even more riders. Uncertainty about the
effects of a bill can be expressed directly. If a portion of constituents
benefit from proposed legislation, and another portion suffer, a senator can
express these proportions directly in the vote share.

Of course, each senator could still go all-in with each vote, business as
usual. This is in fact a *good* thing: it means that each individual senator
gets *more* power to save political face, without directly removing any other
power or immediately threatening the institutions that get those senators
elected.

Changing the voting style of the Senate would require a constitutional
referendum, and it is unrealistic to expect a direct campaign to be
successful. Instead, if you believe this to be a good idea, demonstrate its
viability in the `laboratories of democracy`_. Petition your city council to
employ it locally. Use it at PTA meetings. Bake it in to your company's board
of directors\ [#]_.

.. [#]  Founders, I'm looking at you here.

Whereever you give individuals the power of choice, make sure they aren't
forced into a false certainty in order to express it.
