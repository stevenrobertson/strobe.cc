Voting in the face of uncertainty

In the 112th US Senate, party-line voting is rampant. 78 members `voted with
their party affiliation`_ more than 90% of the time.

Further, changing stance on an issue has considerable political consequences.
Individual senators who have done so have faced charges of flip-flopping or
politicking, even in situations where new evidence justifies such a change.

Junior senators are politically constrained to vote within party lines. These
lines cannot change without exposing more senior members to political
repercussions, and so do not. As a result, historical precedent shapes policy
in perpetuity.

A senator is ethically obligated to vote in a manner that will bring the least
harm upon his or her constituients. Since votes on many bills are politically
constrained by the core issues they address, the only way to minimize harm —
to even *appear* to do this — is to operate through side-channels. This is
evidently done through favor trading, back-room deals, and adding pork to
legislation.

Techniques to oppose legislation, from filibustering to the brinksmanship of
recent weeks, have arisen in part due to the failure of the legislative
process to produce bills which minimize harm without challenging precedent. In
many cases, this is in fact an impossible task, as precedent may now be
harmful.

A root cause, I believe, is the implied certainty of a yea or nay vote. This
binary choice is the mother of all quantization errors, reducing the depth and
nuance of most political issues to a single precedent-setting choice. By
forcing every issue to become an "if you're not with us, you're against us"
affair, the lack of voting granularity drives each party further from each
other and from a sensible middle ground.

A solution presents itself: give each senator one hundred votes instead of
one\ [#]_.

Under such a system, senators could meaningfully encode their uncertainty
about a decision into the voting record as a proportion of votes cast for or
against a bill. As information accumulates about an area of policy, those
proportions can be adjusted by each senator gradually, providing a face-saving
means to shift precedent over time without appearing inconsistent. Further,
senators can forego the side-channel process of harm minimization in favor of
directly expressing their estimates of harm in their voting proportions.

Or senators could just keep going all-in on every vote. That's actually a good
thing: it means that this idea can be adopted without removing any tools from
incumbents' political arsenals.

Nevertheless, changing the voting style of the Senate would be a dramatic
move, and it is unrealistic to expect a direct campaign to be successful.  It
would be easier to prove the idea as beneficial to both politicans and their
constituients by demonstrating it in the `laboratories of democracy`_. If you
find this idea interesting, petition your city council, school board, and
other local bodies of governance to give it a try.
